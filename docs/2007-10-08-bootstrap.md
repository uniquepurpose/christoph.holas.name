I decided to use a weblog instead of creating a personal website because I'm too lazy (and not creative enough) to create a design which represents me and my feelings, ideas, et cetera. A CMS (content management system) is easily set up and doesn't need too much maintenance.

Update 2021-09-28: CMS is a hassle for me. Back to static pages, with Jekyll this time.
